# eBackpack
 
I have used Laravel, WAMP and HTML Template to make this project. Below are the steps to set up this project on your machine.


Steps to setup project:

1) Download the code as Zip. Extract the zip file and you will find one folder named “eBackpack” or create the folder and put all files inside it.
2) Copy this folder to /www or /htdocs directory
3) Open eBackpack folder and import ebackpack.sql to your database.
4) Now open terminal and go to /eBackpack
5) Run “php artisan serve” (You will find the local server address in the terminal to run the project.)
    OR
    Go to http://localhost/eBackpack/public/ after starting your local server.
6) If you don’t wish to create a new user, use this credentials for login.
